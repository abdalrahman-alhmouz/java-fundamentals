# java-fundamentals
 * This repository is about java labs for 10 labs.
 - each lab will be in seperate file named by what are the things inside the file.
 - Note: all labs will be initialized using gradle, and if i don't i will add which app was created without it bew this line.
 - Language and framework
- I will be using only java langauge.
- for testing this code do the test inside the app

=======
# lab-02 and lab-03
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 * write for function  and do a test for each one .
 * i wrote a roll method that accept int number this methode must give me a random number btween [1-6] and it must return array with number length ;
 * as i also wrote a calculateTowDiemention method that accebt 2d array and sum the value of each row in this array and i return the maximum total som value ;
 * as i also wrote a calculateAvg method that accebt  array and sum the value in this array and i return the total som value ;


# lab-02 and lab-03
* In this lab, the first thing I did was read the file, then I made a for loop containing many if statements , each statement had a condition if any line contained ( At the end of the line) any of these symbols (;, {,}, if, another) and a null line .
Otherwise, just print this line (line: “+ (i + 1) +” missing semicolon) with the line number

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
 * actually it was hard  speacialy 2d array  .

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 * self working

## Solution
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
acttualy the soultion time was 5 hour .
