# lab-03
* In this lab, the first thing I did was read the file, then I made a for loop containing many if statements , each statement had a condition if any line contained ( At the end of the line) any of these symbols (;, {,}, if, another) and a null line .
Otherwise, just print this line (line: “+ (i + 1) +” missing semicolon) with the line number
